# Intro to Artificial Life (CS 396 at Northwestern University)

In this course, I explored software, hardware, and wetware approaches to Artificial Life. Through weekly readings and the use of bio/physical computer simulations, I explored how to model, predict, design, manufacture, and control artificial living systems such as virtual creatures, physical robots, and biological machines. Each of the branches corresponds to a different component of the robot creation. 

## A (Setup)
I setup the proper environment and installed the necessary tools for programming the robot.

## B (Simulation)
I simulated the virtual world where the robot lives, using Pybullet. 

## C (One link)
Using links, I created a 3-D creature

## D (Many links)
Using links again, I built a whole virtual world. 

## E (Joints)
I used joints to connect multiple links between and within objects
